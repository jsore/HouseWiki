__Milestones__

  - ~~Get physically moved into the house~~


<br><br>


__General knowledge, tips__

  - You can apply to other lenders within ~~15~~ 14 days without impacting credit
  - Insurance: make sure we have __replacement__ cost, not depreciation cost
  - This: `https://www.dhititle.com/Buyer-Resource-Center`
  - ** notes from picture from tiff in messenger Dec 18th ~12:40pm **
  - ** notes from the rest of the folder's docs **


<br><br>


__Things we need to remember to consider__

  - ~~Preliminary estimates for house approval upper end: __$240k-$250k__~~
  - ~~Toll cost~~
  - ~~Crime rate~~
  - ~~Traffic~~
  - ~~School district~~
  - ~~( petty ) Sun in eyes during commute or at your back?~~
  - ~~Cable/internet/electric companies for the area~~


<br><br>


__Questions for each visited lender/house/community__

  - Builder/lender: Who will oversee the construction?

  - What's your completion date policy? Do we get any sort of SLA if a build is delayed by something not caused by us? Is there an option to hold back funds for builder delays?

  - When can I come see the property during construction? Any rules?

  - What would taxes/insurance/HOA cost for this house?

  - What's the ( more descriptive ) time line of house approval - house built - house move-in ready? What about the community? ( ex: Aubrey @ 8 months vs. Princeton @ 2/3 months )

  - Does the contract have cost escalation clause?

  - What's the timing for 3rd parry new construction for home inspections? ( some builders don't want inspectors on the property during the build process, possibility of poor construction practices )

  - ( during construction ) What's your status on the three inspection milestones? ( before they pour, before drywall, before walk through )

  - Lender: would `any specific agreement signed` have penalties for leaving the home before xx amount of months/years?

  - What's the slope of the lot? ( would it be on a hill, would it be difficult for him to play outside )

  - Do you have a list of vendors we need to meet throughout the process? Where are they located?

  - When are upgrades paid for? Upfront or at closing?



<br><br>



__General Questions__

  - ( For HBC ) I want to refinance my car. Good idea or bad?

  - ( For DR Horton ) What are the HBC milestones? What're you looking for when reviewing banking/financial records? Any specificities we need to be aware of for obtaining approval?

  - ( For DR Horton ) Tech specs for smarthome installations? ( Justin is the interested party with this )

  - We've seen Princeton and Aubrey. Are there any other communities near or in between that'd be cheaper?

  - ~~Whats the inspection process like?~~

  - When we sign a purchase agreement does that lock in the price of the home? ( ex: we give the deposit now to hold a spot while we work on fixing credit and don't sign on a house until xx months later )

  - ~~Can you make additional upgrades once the home started? Any limits on that? ( i.e. nothing structural, etc etc )~~

  - What is a PID community/neighborhood? Why should we like/dislike it? ( Procure documentation from Cheri, Princeton is PID )

  - What's a MUD community? Why should we like/dislike it?

  - We've seen people with issues with water drainage between lots. Was this resolved? What was the issue? Is there a place where we can file a dispute or claim if we happen to run into this issue, in Aubrey specifically, but also in any other community?

  - What's a Purchase Agreement?

  - What's the difference between a Rate and APR on a mortgage loan?

  - Cheri: is the community USDA?

  - Can you provide us with an HOA rules and regulations sheet?

  - What incentives do you have for using you as a lender? ( get it in writing )


<br><br>


__Wish List__

 - ~~Good lighting~~
 - ~~Good fixtures~~
 - ~~__Extra living area__ ( gameroom/bonus room )~~
 - ~~__Office space__~~

<br><br>

__House TODO's__

  - [ ] Look up school ratings in Princeton vs. Aubrey
  - [ ] Organize documents and notes from DR Horton folders
  - [x] Programmatic approach to tracking _<b>all</b> of this_

### Supplemental project notes to track for sanity

  > https://github.com/jsore/notes

  > ~~Getting~~ Keeping my thoughts in order


<br><br>


__Python env__

My main programming experience has been vanilla ES5/6 JavaScript ( plus all the stuff required for server administration/DNS/website hosting on a Node.js + NGINX or Apache platform ). I'm not new to Python but I am still a novice, specifically when speaking about Django's supplied libraries and methodologies. I'm going to migrate this wiki to my domain eventually and will need to know about any clashes between my Node/PM2 site with this, and will need to research how to join this wiki and it's Python based code with my existing reverse proxy.

Eventually I want to migrate my existing site to pure Python. There will be some headaches so hopefully if I keep decent records of what I do before pushing to prod it'll help.

Activate the `home` app in the project's `settings.py` then create ( migrate and apply the migrations ) the tables for the initial applications in the pre-existing SQLite DB

  ```
  (house_wiki) …/HouseWiki/housewiki
  $ python manage.py migrate
  ```

Then spin up the dev server. Remember: use WSGI for prod and Django can run the server on a different settings file, useful for dealint with multiple environments requring a different settings file ( different configurations ).

  ```
  (house_wiki) …/HouseWiki/housewiki
  $ python manage.py runserver

  # optional, use a different settings file and specify a different default port
  (house_wiki) …/HouseWiki/housewiki
  $ python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8001 --settings=differentsitename.settings
  ```




<br><br>




Now it's just a case of building the models. Got a few of them done so far. General process:

  __1. Create the models to define database management details__

  From the 'What this project should accomplish section', each item needs a model. This defines how data related to each item is manipulated or presented in the DB.


  __2. Add the models to Django's admin site for each project app__

  Example, the `home` application's admin rules get defined here:

  `…/HouseWiki/housewiki/home/admin.py`


  __3. Create the application's views__

  Define how the data from each model should be rendered to a user on a webpage


  __4. Define a URL pattern for each view__

  Endpoints to determine where to take the user based on the URL path


  __5. Write the template for each view__

  This is the HTML that takes attributes passed to it from the view and defines how to display them
