# HouseWiki

For the wife and I, an attempt to keep our sanity in check during our house buying process.

### Wiki structure

What this repo accomplishes. It should be able to do, provide a space for, or track:

<br>

  - [ ] Milestones
    + track list format
    + provide a `textarea` for comments regarding how the milestone was accomplished

<br>

  - [ ] Questions we have that need to be answered
    + unordered list format
    + make them answerable
    + flag them as 'answered' if answered

<br>

  - [ ] Houses section
    + unordered list format, but with a 'ranking' option in the list ( 1 to 3 stars )
    + under each house in the aggregated list of houses and within each house:
      * description of house layout and provide an option to bold any specific description ( for favorites ) and an option of making the text red ( for specific dislikes )
      * section for specific likes and dislikes with optional area for elaborating
      * easily post and navigate through pictures
    + links to floor plans or community websites within each individual house
    + section for questions we may have about each house and community
      * aggregate each question into the 'Questions' section of the wiki
    + grouped by section, organized by highest rank to least
    + sidebar of top 3

<br>

  - [ ] General wish list for what we want in a house and community

<br>

  - [ ] A secure place for document storage

<br>

  - [ ] Contacts section
    + unordered list format
    + names of people and what they're supposed to help with
    + should actual contact info be listed or not?

__Questions__

  - What is a PID community/neighborhood? Why should we like/dislike it? ( Procure documentation from Cheri, Princeton is PID )

  - What's a MUD community? Why should we like/dislike it?

  - We've seen people with issues with water drainage between lots. Was this resolved? What was the issue? Is there a place where we can file a dispute or claim if we happen to run into this issue, in Aubrey specifically, but also in any other community?

  - What's a Purchase Agreement?

  - What's the difference between a Rate and APR on a mortgage loan?

  - Cheri: is the community USDA?

  - What's the ( more descriptive ) time line of house approval - house built - house move-in ready? What about the community? ( ex: Aubrey @ 8 months vs. Princeton @ 2/3 months )


<br><br>


__House TODO's__

  - [ ] Look up school ratings in Princeton vs. Aubrey
  - [ ] Organize documents and notes from DR Horton folders
  - [x] Programmatic approach to tracking _<b>all</b> of this_
